# Node Streams Test
Trying out the FileSystem library to modify files. Credits to K. Farmer for this [JavaScript January post](https://www.javascriptjanuary.com/blog/i-dream-of-node-streams)

## You will need
Node (this one is in version 8.9.1)

## How to do stuff
You can run this program by building it and typing ```node streams.js``` in the command line. This will (re)generate a .txt file that contains the encrypted version of the my.txt-file.
You can modify the .txt-files and see the outcome. You can also modify the encryption algorithm, which is a modification of the [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) encryption technique.
